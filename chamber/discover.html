                        <p>
                            Ikeja, which was formally called "Akeja", is the capital city of Lagos State in southwestern Nigeria. 
                            Its population, as of the 2006 census, is 313,196. Prior to the emergence of military rule in the early 1980s, Ikeja was a well planned, clean and quiet residential and commercial town with shopping malls, pharmacies and government reservation areas. 
                            It lies 10.5 miles (17 km) northwest of Lagos city.[2] The Murtala Muhammed International Airport is located in the city. 
                            Ikeja is also home to Femi Kuti's Africa Shrine and Lagbaja's Motherland, both venues for live music.

                        <h1>Canoe Monument Statue</h1>
                        <p>
                            This is a 30 feet tall installation of an indigenous life size wooden canoe made in fibre glass to depict Lagos Water Ways, life style, the culture and coastline traditions. 
                            Lagos is an open canvas for creative mind and the canoes will always be there in our hearts to keep bringing in creativity.
                            This statue simply explains the core occupation of the first settlers in Lagos which was fishing. 
                            This then introduced the use of canoes to represent each local government within Lagos state.
