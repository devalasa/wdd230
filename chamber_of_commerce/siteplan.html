                <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
                <p>The Ikeja City Chamber of Commerce site seeks to connect businesses with the community we serve.
                    We know that every community thrives on those who live, work and play there, so we are dedicated
                    to connecting the businesses within the community with those who also call Ikeja home. 
                    The primary objective of the Chamber is to promote, support or oppose legislative or other measures affecting trade, 
                    industry, commerce and agriculture. The Chamber represents the opinion of the business community on the above matters in particular and economy as a whole. 
                    This site will provide a brief historical narrative of Ikeja through the years, from a small farming community
                    to a booming economic center. This site will also provide a directory of the businesses which are run
                    here.
