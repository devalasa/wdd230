    <h3>Persona 2</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">Dozie and Chidinma Udoh are a young married couple who moved from Anambra, Lagos and have
        recently settled in Ikeja. Dozie and Chidinma want to open a resturant featuring flavors from back home. 
        With a demographic that supports this type of restaurant venture, they are interested in looking for spaces that will allow them to run the restaurant, but they would
        also like to have a banquet space that can be rented out. Families are essential in their culture, and gathering
        in families would make a great business venture if they offer a place for families to rent out. They 
        would like to connect with other business owners in the area as well as teach others in their
        community about their culture.
